# CopyOf_IMDbAnalysis
This .ipynb file was originally made by Rajat2712. 
I use this copy to add on my own analysis. 
To access this, and use it, use the link:
https://colab.research.google.com/github/liujean/IMDb-analysis/blob/master/IMDb%20analysis.ipynb#scrollTo=NhlNEftSZ1vS
Then download the two required datasets from https://datasets.imdbws.com/ and unzip them, then place them as files in the project.
